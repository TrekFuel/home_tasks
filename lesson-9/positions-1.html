  <p><strong>Audi AG</strong> is a German automobile manufacturer that
    designs,
    engineers, produces, markets and
    distributes luxury vehicles. Audi is a member of the Volkswagen Group and
    has
    its roots at Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. Audi-branded vehicles are
    produced
    in nine production facilities worldwide.</p>
  <p>The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th
    century
    and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer
    August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), leading to the
    foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern era of Audi essentially began
    in
    the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.
    After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103
    series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus
    creating the present day form of the company.</p>
  <p>The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the
    founder, August Horch. "Horch", meaning "listen" in German, becomes "audi"
    in
    Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car
    companies that banded together to create Audi's predecessor company, Auto
    Union. Audi's slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, meaning "Being Ahead
    through
    Technology". However, Audi USA had used the slogan "Truth in Engineering"
    from
    2007 to 2016, and have not used the slogan since 2016. Audi, along with
    fellow German marques BMW and Mercedes-Benz, is among the best-selling
    luxury
    automobile brands in the world.</p>
