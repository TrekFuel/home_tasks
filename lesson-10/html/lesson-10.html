    The original Meta was a classic aggressive trail bike – the new Meta has a
    lot to live up to. Happily, a complete frame reworking has kept all the
    rider interaction and naturally insolent spark of the original, but framed
    it in a phenomenally stiff chassis with even better suspension control. The
    result? The What Mountain Bike Flat Out Fun Bike award for 2012.
    Here’s what the judges had to say:
    “Just looking at the super-sloped top tube, compact rear end and the way the
    shock’s packed low into the centre of the bike – above the big press-fit
    bottom bracket – you can see it’s a low-slung gravity bomb.
    The downhill-style, 66-degree head angle, Fox 36 fork and screw-through
    142x12mm rear axle confirm its serious intent, while internal cable routing
    (including ports for a remote dropper post) give super-clean lines.
    Commencal have had the sense to put the money into crucial areas. The Fox
    fork, Formula RX brakes, Mavic rims, Maxxis Ardent tyres and a well-shaped
    cockpit mean it’s ready to go nuts straight from the shop.
    Despite ingeniously-driven suspension that feels too soft in the car park,
    the Meta meters shock movement perfectly whatever it’s pounding through. It
    glues the rear wheel to the ground, drives forward off rollers and boulders
    and swallows big drops with a seemingly bottomless verve.
    Yet there’s plenty of platform to really press your feet into berms as you
    strain your neck looking for the exit – the tracking accuracy from both ends
    is outstanding.
    The result is a bike that leaves all but the best, most carefully set up
    big-money bikes standing on typically tight and techy UK descents. While the
    short position means you’re going to be cramped, excellent pedalling manners
    mean it winches you back to the top as efficiently as you could hope for on
    a steroidal 32lb hooligan.”
    Outstanding composure, coupled with the unshakable stiffness of the SX
    chassis, makes the SX an insatiable ripper straight away. Even at the end of
    long, sodden trail testing sessions where we’d totally had enough, jumping
    onto the Meta put the fun back into the riding. However hard we turned in,
    it still had more to give mid-corner, relishing the chance to rail round on
    the big Ardent side knobs with totally communicative yet surefooted
    assurance.
    While it’s short in the rider compartment, overall wheelbase is long enough
    for decent stability. We were wary at first but it never fluttered, tucked
    or threatened to high-side us even at ball shrinking speeds. It handles big
    block hits well enough to face broken geology with a grin. We genuinely
    struggled to find something the suspension didn’t feel great on, despite a
    bare minimum of tuning.

    Its sharpness also means pinpoint accuracy when slotting rocks, hooking
    berms or hitting emergency exit lines on unseen off-piste carnage. The
    super-short top tube/cockpit reach and short chainstays make it easy to
    really chuck around, whether that’s to pump or pre-jump extra speed out of
    the trail or showboat for fun.
    The suspension naturally squeezes additional push out of the back sides of
    jumps, rocks or landings, continuing its upward spiral of combative
    confidence. Because it comes out of almost every section level and straight,
    you can pile on the power immediately for maximum gain, whether you’ve got a
    number on the bars or just a grudge against the guy behind.
    While the hefty overall weight takes some grunt to get moving, if you can
    cope with the stunted cockpit space and constricted breathing it pedals well
    enough to leave the ProPedal threshold lever untouched on all but the
    longest, smoothest climbs.

    The unmissably yellow frame has plenty of reason to stand proud on the
    trail. The tapered head tube includes ports for internal gear and brake
    routing as well as a spare hole for the seatpost remote hose if you can be
    bothered to disconnect it and thread it through.
    There’s a long shared maintube seam for stiffness, and the tubes themselves
    – including the seat tube brace – are very broad rectangular sections to
    remove any rotational twist. The low-slung top tube keeps that centre of
    gravity very low. The shock is also mounted low and centrally inside the big
    hollow window in the super-broad, press-fit bottom bracket and main pivot
    keystone.
    Massive seatstays drive the broad faux bar rocker linkage, and a 142x12mm
    screw-through axle locks the back end together behind the big, double-sided
    seatstay pivots. Internal cable routing continues through the asymmetrically
    offset chainstays and there’s masses of mud room, even with the big, 2.4in
    rear tyres.
    The extra large Maxxis Ardent tyres – our favourite fast-rolling rubber –
    are just one of the things that Commencal have got totally right with the
    spec, despite it being one of the cheapest bikes here.
    The Mavic rims they sit on are reliable heavy-duty classics, and Commencal
    hubs have always been fine in extended use. A remote-control dropper
    seatpost is an enduro essential, and the RockShox Reverb post is another
    MBUK fave. The bar is wide enough for decent leverage when the trail turns
    random under your front wheel, without being so broad that every passing
    tree becomes a punchbag. The short, squat stem is spot on, too.
    The Formula RX brakes are super sharp and the post-mount 180mm rotor rear
    makes adjustment easy. While more downhill-focused riders are bound to end
    up fitting a guide on the ISCG tabs, the suspension is so smooth that we had
    no issues with dropping the chain on the 2×10 setup, even on rocky,
    pedal-stabbing sections. Short 170mm cranks offset the low bottom bracket in
    terms of ground clearance. Even with internal routing, the SRAM gears need
    more TLC than Shimano to keep them smooth though.
    It’s the suspension tune on the Meta that Commencal have really got right.
    The Fox 36 fork up front has the simpler open bath damper rather than a
    sealed cartridge, but small bump performance is excellent and it rarely felt
    flustered, however hard we ragged it down stuff. The RP2 damper at the rear
    has a pretty much perfect compression tune for the linkage, too. It feels
    very soft in the car park and traction is excellent in corners, but hit the
    trails and it’s totally poised at every point in the stroke, only bottoming
    out on properly cartilage-compressing loads.

    The Meta line is Commencal’s answer to the Enduro scene. The brand’s
    flagship is now on its 4th iteration, but they’ve decided to re-release the
    V3 version. This allows them to hit a more affordable price point, while
    still offering consumers a killer deal.
    For just $2,199, you get a complete that’s spec’d with a RockShox Lyric
    fork, a RockShox Monarch Plus shock, and a SRAM NX 1x drivetrain. The best
    part? They haven’t “updated” it with boost spec, so your “old” parts will
    play nice.
    By the numbers, the Meta SX will lend itself to jibs and jumps--it isn't too
    long, but is plenty slack and squishy. This build includes a
    170-millimeter-travel RockShox Lyrik RC, a Monarch Plus RC3 shock, SRAM NX
    11-speed drivetrain, and Maxxis High Roller II tires, though it should be
    noted the Meta SX doesn’t run on Boost rear spacing. The NX cranks are a
    little under-gunned for a bike this gnarly, but the Meta SX is a great
    example of a brand putting your money into higher-priced and (ideally)
    longer-lasting hardware like frame and suspension. Case in point; a dropper
    post is not included, but that won't matter when you do most of your
    climbing seated on a chairlift or in a pickup truck. Wheels: 27.5 Travel
