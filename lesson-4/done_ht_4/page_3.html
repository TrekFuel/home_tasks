    Developers will soon be able to test applications on a live version of blockchain interoperability protocol
    Polkadot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kusama, an experimental and unaudited version of the <a
      href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-co-founders-polkadot-closes-token-sale-claiming-1-2-billion-valuation"
      target="_blank">$1.2 billion</a> network, was launched on Friday at the tail-end of
    Berlin Blockchain Week.
  </p>
  <p>
    As highlighted <a href="https://medium.com/@gavofyork/kusama-rollout-and-governance-31eb18041044" target="blank">in
    a blog post</a> by Polkadot creator Gavin Wood, it will be somewhere between one to four weeks before
    developers can begin tapping the full functionality of the network. Until at least 50 “well-backed” validators are
    operating on the network, transfers of <a
      href="https://www.coindesk.com/expect-chaos-polkadot-to-launch-experimental-kusama-network-this-summer"
      target="_blank">KSM tokens</a> between users will not be possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wood explained in the post which actions are now live:
  </p>
  <div class="quote">
    <blockquote>
      “Functionality that will be enabled is limited to usage of the Staking, Sessions and Claims modules; specifically,
      bonding, nominating and issuing an intention to become a validator, setting up one’s session keys and claiming
      KSMs will be supported.”
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <p>
    Once fully functioning, the Kusama network is expected to act as the proving ground for some of the most
    bleeding-edge technology planned for the actual Polkadot network, which is tentatively expected for launch <a
      href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadot-the-foundation-of-a-new-internet-e8800ec81c7" target="_blank">early
    next year</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wood spent much of Berlin Blockchain Week explaining the goals of the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Already, one of the teams expected to build on Polkadot is planning to run its applications on Kusama in the coming
    weeks.

    <a href="https://kilt.io/" target="_blank">KILT Protocol</a> project lead Ingo Ruebe said:
  </p>
  <div class="quote">
    <blockquote>
      “We want to be part of this ecosystem but we have the feeling that not everything from a conceptual point of view
      has been thought through to the end so there’s still questions.”
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <p>
    Running KILT’s “virtual structures” on Kusama will serve to answer many questions, Ruebe said, including the
    auctioning structure of Polkadot parachains.
