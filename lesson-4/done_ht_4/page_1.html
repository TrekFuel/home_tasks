    <p>
      Circle is hiring a new general partner to raise a $100 million venture capital fund.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fund will take advantage of the deal flow coming through SeedInvest, the equity crowdfunding startup that
      Circle
      acquired in <a

      March
      2019</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The listing <a

    _learning&clickid=xsQQL2QiExyJWOiwUx0Mo3EzUklXBwTstVhRXY0&irgwc=1">on LinkedIn says</a>: “The Partner will be
      expected to develop and drive an investment thesis designed to
      leverage SeedInvest’s sizable deal flow and its unique network of 250,000 investors to maximize returns.”
    </p>
    <p>
      SeedInvest emphasizes itself a registry of potential startup investments that have been thoroughly vetted by the
      firm before they are shown to users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The posting says Circle is seeking someone with principal or partner-level experience at an established venture
      firm
      and strong connections throughout the funder community.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the SeedInvest acquisition, Circle noted that the startup opened an opportunity to tokenize equity
      in
      new companies. In a joint blog post at the time, the cofounders wrote:
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
      <blockquote>
        “We believe that the tokenization of financial assets will ultimately unlock capital for growing companies and
        investment opportunities for people everywhere.”
      </blockquote>

    <p>
      Circle did not provide additional comments after multiple requests. SeedInvest did not reply to a request for
      comment.
