    Problems with Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, are disrupting services at some cryptocurrency exchanges on Friday.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Binance exchange is seeing problems internationally, according to its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who tweeted:
  </p>
  <div class="quote">
    <blockquote>
      AWS is having an issue, mostly with caching services, affecting some users globally. We are working with them and
      monitoring the situation closely.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <p>
    The KuCoin cypto exchange is also saying there are problems with its AWS Tokyo-hosted services.
  </p>
  <p>
    The firm states on its website:
  </p>
  <div class="quote">
    <blockquote>
      “Due to the overheating of part of our chassis in the machine room we deployed in AWS, Tokyo, part of our services
      might become unavailable. The engineering operation team is currently deploying relevant resources of high
      availability across regions to deal with any possible emergencies that might happen. Some services might be
      effected during the deployment.”
    </blockquote>

    Founding partner at Primitive Ventures Dovey Wan has <a
      href="https://twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1164795645804179456" target="_blank">tweeted</a> that a number of Asian
    exchanges are affected and the
    AWS issues are producing erratic market data.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Many Asian exchanges see price instability (and trades were able to execute, yes you can buy extremely cheap
    Bitcoin if you had limit orders there),” she wrote.
  </p>
  <p>
    She also tweeted a screen grab, apparently of order book data from an unnamed exchange that a customer had posted in
    the BitMax exchange’s official Telegram channel. It suggests traders have been able to buy 45 bitcoin for less than
    $1 (in the tether stablecoin, USDT). The price of bitcoin at time of writing should be around $10,190, according to
    CoinDesk’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">global average price index</a>.
